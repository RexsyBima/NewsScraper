(AP) \u2014 President-elect Donald Trump declared a win on stopping illegal immigration through Mexico on Wednesday after talking with that country\u2019s leader. But Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum suggested Mexico was already doing its part and had no interest in closing its borders.\nThe two spoke just days after Trump threatened to impose sweeping new tariffs on Canada and Mexico as part of his effort to crack down on illegal immigration and drugs.\nTrump said Sheinbaum \u201cagreed to stop Migration through Mexico.\u201d Sheinbaum indicated separately on social media that she told Trump that Mexico is already \u201ctaking care of\u201d migrant caravans, calling it an \u201cexcellent conversation.\u201d\n\u201cWe reiterate that Mexico\u2019s position is not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and between peoples,\u201d Sheinbaum added.\nWhile the state of the proposed tariffs remained unclear, Trump said in a post on his Truth Social account that this was \u201ceffectively closing our Southern Border.\u201d He called it a \u201cvery productive conversation.\u201d\nThe exchange between the two leaders appeared to confirm for Trump the value of threatening to disrupt trade with import taxes. His initial social media post moved financial markets and gave him a response he was quick to describe as a win. Even if the proposed tariffs fail to materialize, Trump can tell supporters that the mere possibility of them is an effective policy tool and continue to rely on tariff threats.\nSheinbaum wrote on social media that the leaders \u201cdiscussed Mexico\u2019s strategy on migration issues, and I told him the caravans are not reaching the northern (U.S.) border, because Mexico is taking care of them.\u201d\n\n\n\u201cWe also talked about reinforcing cooperation on security issues, within the framework of our sovereignty, and the campaign we are carrying out to prevent fentanyl consumption,\u201d she said.\nIllegal migration across the Mexico border is down in part because the Biden administration secured some stepped-up cooperation from Mexico \u2014 the sort Trump seems to be celebrating. \nArrivals at the U.S.-Mexico border have dropped 40% from an all-time high in December. U.S. officials mostly credit Mexican vigilance around rail yards and highway checkpoints.\nDriven by mounting pressure from the U.S. to block migrants going north, in the past few years Mexican authorities have turned to rounding them up across the country and sending them to southern Mexico, in a strategy seen by experts as an attempt to wear migrants out until they give up.\nNeither side clarified the status of the tariffs. But their implementation could fuel higher prices and slow economic growth, potentially blowing up the trade agreement among the U.S., Canada and Mexico that was finalized in 2020 during Trump\u2019s previous time in the White House.\nTrump on Monday said he would impose a 25% tax on all products entering the country from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders upon taking office on Jan. 20. He also proposed an additional 10% tariff on China tied to its exporting of materials used in the production of fentanyl.\nIn announcing his plans, he railed against the flow of fentanyl and migrants crossing into the U.S. illegally, even though southern border apprehensions have been hovering near four-year lows.\nOn Wednesday, Trump also posted that he plans a large scale ad campaign to explain \u201chow bad Fentanyl is for people to use,\u201d predicting it would educate people on \u201chow really bad the horror of this Drug is.\u201d\nThe dangerously powerful opioid was developed to treat intense pain from ailments like cancer but has increasingly been mixed with other drugs in the illicit drug supply.\nThrough September, the United States has imported $378.9 billion in goods from Mexico, $322.2 billion from China and $309.3 billion from Canada.\nAssociated Press writers Jill Colvin in New York and Mark Stevenson in Mexico City contributed to this report. \n", "img_url": "https://dims.apnews.com/dims4/default/efd49ca/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5758x3837+0+1/resize/980x653!/format/webp/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fassets.apnews.com%2Fd7%2F35%2Fbf492720d3f8f39c1d731a9aa301%2Fe4e0e569c9bd4adab91f022e56758035", "id": null}
